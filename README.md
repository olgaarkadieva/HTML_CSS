														<p>The Devon Rex is a breed of intelligent, short-haired cat that typically is active, mischievous, playful, and very people-oriented. They have been described as a cross between a cat, a dog and a monkey. Devons prefer to be in high places and will go to great lengths to get to the highest spot in a room. They are relatively easy to take care of. Most Devons also have one central person to whom they devote their love, and on whom they will most often lie and rub.They like to playfully nip, and love to play throughout their lives.
